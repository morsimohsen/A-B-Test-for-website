# A-B-Test-for-E-Commerce-website_DataScience

## Project Idea

we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:

Implement the new webpage,
Keep the old webpage, or
Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
